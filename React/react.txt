Har component ki alag se file hogi


For Import And Export Single File
we use Import =
import Title from './Title'
for export this file
export Default Title;


for Import and Export multiple files- 
export {Title};
inport {Title} from "./Title"

React Fragement---
Means a small part==

Ager app harr jagah div or childer class ka use nahi karena chahetee to ham
<> </> Iseka bhii use kar sakte hai



// JSX me jab bhii ham { } curlie brackets me koi bhi code likhte hai to vo pure JS ki tarah treat hota hai 
 

 Map Method 
 arr.map((variable (a), index) => (  // a move or travel or access to all the index
    <h1 key = {index}>{a}</h1>
 ))


// React Hooks (It is like a Loop)

Hooks Type - UseState (Kisi object ki state me change karena -- Matlb object me koi bhi value hai useko update krne ke liye kaam ata hai)
[variable name, function name] function is used to handle the error

const [count , setCount] = useState('0' // This is initial value);


//To Print the event Object we have to pass parameters event in function 


//State in React

We use it to re-render any object


There are total 15 Hooks in React   



What is closure.?


When we have two function outer and inner 
In outer function we declare a variable b 
and in inner function we declare a variable a 
now in variable a I have to add a + b;
but in inner we have b but not have a - so we sure Closure property to access the b variable of outer in inner 

ex:

function outer() {
    let b = 10;
    function inner() {
        let a = 20;
        console.log(a + b);
    }
    return inner;
}

let inner = outer();
then call inner(); // This is an closure method
we can get our solution
