Component is Like A Fucntion we can use it Many Time in our code One its defined in code.. (reusable) -- ex- We create a button and we use the same button many time in code

--------- When we have to use same component we Will invoke The component(call or Render)
----------Render means Kisi Chij ko bar bar call karwana or Display karwana 

---------- Herarcy means components of a object 
---Like := video 
             |

---- In React Har ek component ka HTML , CSS , JS alag hai 

------IN React we write the coode in JSX Form (By addling Html)

************************ JSX ****************************88
-- It is not JS 
Babel is a tool which convert the JSX into JS 


-- Mainlyy we write our code in app.js then we will export the app.js to main or index.js via root and this root is connected to the Index.html



----Work of Index.html is to create root element and connect it to main

main ka kaam hai app component ko root me render karena 


When we have to use inline css we have to define object and pass the valuee or name of object in {}

ex:  

let a = {
    color : red
}


<h2 style = (a)> Hello</h2> 

When we have to use A temprary text box in our html so we have to use 
<h2 contentEditable = "true" className='true'>React</h2> 
It create a text box


With the help of Use effect we will Fetch the API or update it 
UseEffect - It is like an Arrow function and we use setInterval in it
